                    Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information,
                    text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you

                    on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

                    By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is
                    yours
                    (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as
                    provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does
                    not
                    violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any
                    person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on
                    a
                    copyright.

                    You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the

                    use
                    your Content subject to these Terms.

                <h5><b> Accounts</b></h5>

                <p class="re-post-content"> When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is
                    accurate, complete, and
                    current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in
                    immediate
                    termination of your account on our Service.

                    You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any

                    third-party
                    service.

                    You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon
                    becoming
                    aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                    by
                    SnapBlog.

                    SnapBlog has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
                    practices of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that SnapBlog
                    shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged

                <h5><b>Termination</b> </h5>
                <p class="re-post-content"> We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior
                    notice or liability, for
                    any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

                    All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                    termination,
                    including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and
                    limitations of
                    liability.

                    We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
                    reason
                    whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

                    Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate
                    your
                    account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>


                <h5><b>Governing Law</b> </h5>
                <p class="re-post-content"> These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
                    [Your Country], without
                    regard to its conflict of law provisions.

                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                    those
                    rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                    remaining
                    provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
                    us
                    regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us
                    regarding
                    the Service.</p>


                <h5><b>Changes</b> </h5>

                <p class="re-post-content"> We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these
                    Terms at any time. If a
                    revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking
                    effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

                    By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
                    bound
                    by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
